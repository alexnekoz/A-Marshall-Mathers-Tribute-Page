            <p>  Look</p>
            <p>  If you had</p>
            <p>  One shot</p>
            <p>  Or one opportunity</p>
            <p>  To seize everything you ever wanted</p>
            <p>  In one moment</p>
            <p>  Would you capture it</p>
            <p>  Or just let it slip?</p>
            <p>  Yo</p>
            <p>  His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy</p>
            <p>  There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</p>
            <p>  He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready</p>
            <p>  To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin</p>'
            <p>  What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud</p>
            <p>  He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out</p>
            <p>  He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now</p>
            <p>  The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow</p>
            <p>  Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity</p>
            <p>  Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked</p>
            <p>  He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No</p>
            <p>  He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes</p>
            <p>  It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke</p>
            <p>  He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's</p>
            <p>  Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody</p>
            <p>  Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p>
            <p>  You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
            <p>  You own it, you better never let it go</p>
            <p>  You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
            <p>  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
            <p>  You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
            <p>  You own it, you better never let it go</p>
            <p>  You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>

            <p>  You better</p>
            <p>  His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping</p>
            <p>  This world is mine for the taking</p>
            <p>  Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order</p>
            <p>  A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem</p>
            <p>  It only grows harder, only grows hotter</p>
            <p>  He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him</p>
            <p>  Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter</p>
            <p>  Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father</p>
            <p>  He goes home and barely knows his own daughter</p>
            <p>  But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water</p>
            <p>  These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product</p>
            <p>  They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada</p>
            <p>  So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on</p>
            <p>  Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da</p>
            <p>  You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
            <p>  You own it, you better never let it go</p>
            <p>  You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
            <p>  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>

            <p>  You better</p>
            <p>  No more games, I'ma change what you call rage</p>
            <p>  Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged</p>
            <p>  I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed</p>
            <p>  I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage</p>
            <p>  But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher</p>
            <p>  Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper</p>
            <p>  All the pain inside amplified by the</p>
            <p>  Fact that I can't get by with my nine to</p>
            <p>  Five and I can't provide the right type of</p>
            <p>  Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers</p>
            <p>  And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer</p>
            <p>  This is my life and these times are so hard</p>
            <p>  And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus</p>
            <p>  Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna</p>
            <p>  Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much</p>
            <p>  For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's</p>
            <p>  Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got</p>
            <p>  To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot</p>
            <p>  Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not</p>
            <p>  Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot</p>
            <p>  So here I go, is my shot</p>
            <p>  Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got</p>
            <p>  You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p>
            <p>  You own it, you better never let it go</p>
            <p>  You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
            <p>  This opportunity comes once in a lifetime</p>
